    "description": "At around 12m in length and more than six tonnes in weight, Acrocanthosaurus is one of the largest theropods and dates back to the Early Cretaceous period. This carnivorous dinosaur gets its name – which translates to ‘high-spined lizard’ – from the elongated spines running the length of its neck and back, while its sharp teeth and powerful jaw make it a fearsome predator comparable to the much more well-known Tyrannosaurus rex.",
    "discovery": "Acrocanthosaurus was officially discovered in 1950 by J. Willis Stovall and Wann Langston Junior in Atoka County, Oklahoma, when the two palaeontologists dug up skeleton fragments including part of a skull. In the following decades there was little consensus on how to classify Acrocanthosaurus, and at various times it was believed to be a species of Allosaurus, Spinosaurus and Megalosaurus - but it is now considered part of the Carcharodontosaurus family.",
    "palaeoecology": "Fossil findings have confirmed that Acrocanthosaurus lived approximately 110-125 million years ago in the Southern states of the USA, most notably Texas, Oklahoma and Wyoming. Acrocanthosaurus was the apex predator of its time, with a diet consisting of other dinosaurs including Hadrosaurus, Tenontosaurus and Sauropods.",

Corythosaurus weighed around four tonnes and grew up to 9m in length, making it one of the largest Hadrosaurids, with a bill-shaped snout and thousands of small teeth for chewing through tough vegetation.",
    "discovery": "Corythosaurus was discovered in 1911 by renowned American palaeontologist Barnum Brown, who unearthed a near-complete skeleton in Red Deer River, a city in Alberta, Canada. Brown – known as ‘Mr. Bones’ thanks to his stellar reputation in his field – also excavated a significant amount of skin, allowing him to understand more about the genus.",
    "palaeoecology": "Corythosaurus lived in the forests of North America, co-existing with other large herbivores including Parasaurolophus and Centrosaurus.

For many years the genus was misclassified as a Megalosaurus - it wasn’t until 1970 that fellow dinosaur expert Samuel P.

    "discovery": "The first Edmontosaurus bones were discovered in 1891, when the ‘king of collectors’ John Bell Hatcher unearthed them in the Lance Formation, Wyoming. However, the fossils were initially considered a new species of Claosaurus – it wasn’t until 1917, and the discovery of two further skeletons in Edmonton, Canada, that it was classified as a new genus.",
    "palaeoecology": "Edmontosaurus lived during the Late Cretaceous period around 65-75m years ago, and co-existed with dinosaurs like Triceratops, Albertosaurus and Pachycephalosaurus in the subtropical climate of Canada. It shared its environment with the apex predator Tyrannosaurus, relying on its speed and intelligence to stay safe.",

As such, Indominus rex is perhaps the most fearsome dinosaur of all, boasting Giganotosaurus’ size, Velociraptor’s intelligence and speed, Tyrannosaurus rex’s power and aggression, plus further traits from tree frogs and cuttlefish that allow it to hide its thermal signature.",
    "discovery": "American geneticist Dr. Henry Wu began the development of the new genus in 2012, after Jurassic World owner Simon Masrani requested the creation of a new, exciting genus to increase ticket sales. Indominus rex’s conception has been fraught with controversy, however – the genus has proved far more intelligent than anticipated, making worldwide headlines in 2015 when it escaped its paddock and went on a rampage across the park.",
    "palaeoecology": "Due to its synthetic origins, experts are still learning about Indominus rex’s behaviour, diet and natural habitat – it was raised in isolation so that researchers could study it. Indominus rex’s ferocity and intelligence make it the apex predator of its habitat.",

    "description": "Easily recognised thanks to its blunt beak and the small horn on its forehead (its name directly translates into English as ‘small-horned’), Microceratus is an herbivorous dinosaur that lived around 65-85 million years ago during the Cretaceous period. This genus walks on two legs and grows up to 80 centimetres in length - making it one of the smallest dinosaurs the world has seen.",
    "discovery": "Microceratus was first discovered in 1953 by Anders Birger Bohlin during exploration of the Gobi desert in Inner Mongolia - although it was originally named Microceratops. In 2008 - a full 55 years later - it was revealed that the name Microceratops was already attributed to a genus wasp. The new name, Microceratus, was coined by Portuguese palaeontologist Octavio Mateus.",
    "palaeoecology": "Microceratus lived in the woodlands of Asia, feeding on plants and sticking to heavily wooded areas to hide from predators such as Velociraptor. Due to its small stature - the genus weighs around just 14lbs - Microceratus was extremely prone to attack, relying on its high speed to keep itself safe.",

    "description": "Parasaurolophus is an herbivorous hadrosaurid native to North America, and is famed for its unique head crest, which extends out from the back of its head. This distinctive crest gave the dinosaur its name, which translates to ‘near crested lizard’. Parasaurolophus grows up to around 7.5m in length, and while it usually walks on four legs, it can rear up onto two legs if it needs to run or reach food in high places.",
    "discovery": "The first Parasaurolophus discovery came in 1920, when a team of palaeontologists led by William Parks discovered a skull and an incomplete skeleton in Alberta, Canada. Another partial skull was unearthed in New Mexico the following year, and over the next 100 years many more specimens have been unearthed and attributed to Parasaurolophus.",
    "palaeoecology": "The remains of Parasaurolophus have been found across the western United States, Canada and even as far away as Asia. The genus dates back around 75m years to the Late Cretaceous period, when the climate was seasonal but warm, and lived along rivers and near floodplains and swamps, alongside other dinosaurs including Centrosaurus, Styracosaurus and Euoplocephalus.",

The first evidence of Patagotitan was a femur fragment found by Aurelio Hernandez. This led to in-depth expeditions in the Cerro Barcino Formation in Argentina, where fossils were collected between 2012-2015.",
    "palaeoecology": "The Patagotitan co-habited with different sauropod and herbivore groups, where they browsed tall trees and low-growing plants in search of food. They also nested in groups, with 15-40 eggs per clutch. They lived in a warm period with semi-arid periods, traversing flood plains and meandering rivers, all against a backdrop of active volcanoes.",

    "discovery": "Plesiosaurus was discovered by William Conybeare and Henry De la Beche in 1821, although the first complete skeleton was unearthed by renowned British palaeontologist Mary Anning in 1823, while she was searching for fossils in the Lias Group, Dorset. Anning’s find was so unusual that it was initially dismissed as a fake – it was only when similar remains were found in the same location that she was believed.",
    "palaeoecology": "This genus lived entirely in water (although it would surface for air) and swam vast stretches of ocean, with fossils found in Europe, Asia, North America and even Australia. Plesiosaurus’ diet consisted of fish, molluscs and other marine reptiles, which it grabbed with its strong, sharp teeth.",

    "description": "The small theropod Proceratosaurus is a carnivorous dinosaur, and is notable for the bold crest on its snout. Its name comes from the belief, upon its discovery, that the genus was related to Ceratosaurus. However further research has found that it is in fact a cousin of Tyrannosaurus, albeit much smaller at around 4m in length.",
    "discovery": "The sole known Proceratosaurus fossil was discovered by F. Lewis Bradley in 1910 at the White Limestone Formation on the south coast of England, and examination of the specimen (a partial skull) led palaeontologists like Arthur Smith Woodward and Friedrich von Huene to believe it was an ancestor of Ceratosaurus. It wasn’t until almost a century later that studies confirmed Proceratosaurus was a relative of the tyrannosaurs of the Late Cretaceous period.",

They had large eyes capable of binocular vision, and powerful bite capabilities thought to act as a defensive weapon. Protoceratops lived in large herds to survive, and they also had large nests, with up to 12-15 tiny hatchlings in each. Protoceratops laid soft-shell eggs, and buried them to stop them from drying out in the arid desert conditions.",
    "discovery": "The first example of Protoceratops was discovered in 1922, and found in the Djadokhta Formation at the Flaming Cliffs. Further well-preserved specimens were found in 1923 and 1925, and since then many more fossils have been found both in Mongolia and also in Uzbekistan. One of these fossils, found in 1971, is the remains of a Protoceratops and a Velociraptor locked in combat, known as the Fighting Dinosaurs.",
    "palaeoecology": "Protoceratops thrived in harsh climates that ranged from deserts to riverine to conifer-dominated forest patches. With splayed digits and cushiony footpads to maximise foot surface area and thus minimise sinking in sand, they were well-suited to a desert biome. Protoceratops also had rows of serrated, tightly-packed teeth that were perfect for shearing foliage as part of its herbivore diet.",
